**Error analysis:**
```
(1) C0200: consider using enumerate instead of iterating with range and len.

(2) W0611: unused import sys.

(3) R1705: Unnecessary "else" after "return", remove the "else" and de-indent the code inside it (no-else-return) : Indicates unnecessary use of else after return

(4) C0305: Trailing newlines (trailing-newlines): This error tells that there are trailing blank lines in a file.

(5) C0321: More than one statement on a single line: This error tells that there is an on statement are found on the same line.

(6) W0621: Redifining name from outerscope: This mistake indicates that a global variable with the same name as a local variable. By doing this, the global version of the variable is hidden and the local scope is changed to use the local version of the variable.

(7) R1705: Unnecessary "else" after "return", remove the "else" and de-indent the code inside it (no-else-return): This occurs when an else line is added following a "return" statement that is never actually executed.

(8) W0622: Redefining built-in 'input' (redefined-builtin): Used when a built-in is overridden by a variable or method.

(9) C0303: Trailing whitespace (trailing-whitespace): Used when there is whitespace between the end of a line and the newline.

(10) C0103: The variable doesn't match the snake_case naming style. The defined variable is not named using the snake_case convention, as indicated by this error.

(11) C0114/C0ll6: Missing module docstring/function docstring: This indicates that neither the modules nor the functions have a docstring defined. The docstring functions as a kind of comment or text explanation that the compiler ignores but which aids in explaining the function's or module's intended use to others. Writing docstrings is a wise move.
